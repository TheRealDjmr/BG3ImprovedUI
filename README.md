# DISCLAIMER
* The main goal behind an Early Access is to provide meaningful feedback to the developers. To do so, Larian implemented an automatic telemetry that will provide data for them automatically as you play
* Since modding BG3 is not yet officially supported by Larian Studios, you might encounter unexpected problems that it's not in their current scope to fix. **PLEASE DISABLE AUTOMATIC TELEMETRY** and don't post bug reports on their official platforms, as you're playing an unsuported mod
* How to disable telemetry:
