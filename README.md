<b>OPTIONAL FILE REQUIRED</b>
- (Keyboard-only) Dialogue Tweaks - Hides the bottom-left buttons when in dialogue with companions and NPCs where Attack/Trade are not relevant. Can still be accessed by placing your mouse in the bottom-left area. This cleans up the UI when experiencing intimate scenes. (Credit: Wesslan)
- Replaces existing Minimap with smaller version (75% zoom, takes up less space on screen) or no Minimap (leaving the relevant buttons).
